#MouseSim
A zero-player, command-line game about darwinism and a colony of mice

---

This game is still very much a work in progress

---

Currently you can run it with either the defaults or a set of arguments:

> $ java MouseSim

or

> $ java MouseSim numStartingMice maxNumMice maxRuntime gameSpeed


(You can set maxRuntime to -1 to enable infinite runtime. Default gameSpeed is 350.)
